Variable Name,Description,Units,Notes
SITEALL,Site identifier,NA,
Depth_ft,"Water depth at which the macrophyte rake pull was taken
Measured with the macrophyte rake (markings every 0.5 feet)",Feet,
Substrate,"Estimate of substrate hardness, based on feeling with rake
M=muck, S=sand, R=rock
Categories - rock, sand, muck",NA,Categorical
Rake_Total,"Qualitative assessment of biomass on the rake pull (DNR procedure)
0=no plants, 1=a couple plants, 2=most of the rake covered 
in plants but tines still visible, 3=cannot see rake tines under mass of plants ***NOTE there can still be plants at a site marked with a 0 on the rake - these will be visuals, usually of emergent species",NA,Categorical
TOTAL,"Assessment of bed density for mapping purposes - combines visuals with rake samples. 
We scored bed density on a scale of 0-3 based on whether the site yielded no plants on the sampling rake or in sight of the boat (score of 0), 
a few plants on the rake or visible within 2 m of the boat (score of 1), enough plants to fill the rake but leave the tines visible (score of 2), 
or enough plants to completely fill the rake leaving no part of the metal rake head visible (score of 3).",NA,Categorical
